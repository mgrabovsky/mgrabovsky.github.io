    <p>Hello, my name is Matěj Grabovský and I work with computers. Currently, I live
    and work in Brno, Czechia. For most of my career, I have worked primarily with
    web technologies, such as JavaScript, PHP and Python. However, as of late, I have
    been dipping my toes into applied (Bayesian) statistics and probabilistic
    modelling, mostly using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and
    <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>.</p>

    <p>You can get to know some of my code on <a href="https://github.com/mgrabovsky">GitHub</a>
    and my taste in literature on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mgrabovsky">Goodreads</a>.

    <p>If you are interested in working with me or just want to say hello, you
    can drop me an email. My address may be obtained by putting ‘hello’ and
    the at sign (@) before this domain name (mgrabovsky.net).</p>
